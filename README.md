# 🩺 Breast Cancer ML Classifier & Explorer

An interactive machine learning web app built with **Streamlit** that uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset** to explore, preprocess, reduce dimensionality, and classify tumor samples.

# 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in **early breast cancer diagnosis**.  
It allows users to:
- Preview and clean the dataset  
- Select features and scale them  
- Apply PCA for 2D visualization  
- Train multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Evaluate models using:
  - ROC Curve & AUC
  - Classification Report (precision, recall, f1-score)
